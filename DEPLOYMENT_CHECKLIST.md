# üöÄ WebGlo GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Form System Status:
- [ ] Google Apps Script is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Google Sheets is receiving test data
- [ ] Email notifications are working
- [ ] Form handler JavaScript is properly configured
- [ ] Script URL in form-handler.js is correct

### Website Files:
- [ ] All HTML pages load without errors
- [ ] CSS and JavaScript files are working
- [ ] Images display correctly
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs remain
- [ ] All relative paths are correct

## ÔøΩ Security Verification (CRITICAL)

### Pre-Deployment Security Tests:
- [ ] SecurityConfig.js is included in contact.html
- [ ] Form handler uses SecurityConfig for validation
- [ ] Google Apps Script has security validation enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting works (test 2 submissions within 30 seconds)
- [ ] Honeypot field detection works (fill hidden "website" field)
- [ ] Domain validation prevents unauthorized usage
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Security Configuration Checklist:
- [ ] Allowed domains list includes only webglo.org and www.webglo.org
- [ ] Google Apps Script validates source domain
- [ ] Client-side rate limiting: 30 seconds between submissions
- [ ] Server-side rate limiting: 10 seconds global minimum
- [ ] Security tokens are generated and validated
- [ ] Form validation includes email format, message length
- [ ] Spam detection honeypot is properly hidden

### Post-Deployment Security Tests:
1. **Test from authorized domain** (webglo.org):
   - [ ] Form submission works normally
   - [ ] All security checks pass
   - [ ] Emails delivered correctly

2. **Test security measures**:
   - [ ] Submit twice quickly ‚Üí rate limit message appears
   - [ ] Fill honeypot field ‚Üí appears successful but doesn't process
   - [ ] Submit invalid email ‚Üí validation error shown
   - [ ] Empty required fields ‚Üí validation errors shown

3. **Monitor for issues**:
   - [ ] Check Google Apps Script execution logs
   - [ ] Review Google Sheets for any suspicious submissions
   - [ ] Verify security event logging is working

### Security Monitoring Setup:
- [ ] Google Apps Script logs security events
- [ ] Failed validation attempts are recorded
- [ ] Rate limit violations are logged
- [ ] Honeypot triggers are logged

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES

**Your repository is PUBLIC** - this means:
- All code, including security measures, is visible
- Attackers can see form endpoints and email addresses
- Security through obscurity won't work

**Implemented Protections**:
- Multi-layer validation (client + server)
- Domain whitelisting prevents external usage
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Honeypot detection catches simple bots
- Input validation prevents malicious data
- Error handling doesn't expose system details

**If Security Breach Detected**:
1. Immediately disable Google Apps Script
2. Update deployment ID to invalidate endpoints
3. Review logs and submissions for suspicious activity
4. Deploy security patches
5. Monitor for continued issues

For detailed security information, see `SECURITY.md`

## ÔøΩüîß Deployment Steps

### 1. Quick Local Test
```bash
# Test locally first
# Open index.html in browser
# Test contact form submission
# Verify all pages work
```

### 2. Run Deployment Script
```powershell
# In PowerShell, navigate to project folder
cd "c:\Users\georg\OneDrive\Documents\Projects\webglo_site"

# Run deployment script
.\deploy-to-github.ps1
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings ‚Üí Pages
3. Source: Deploy from branch
4. Branch: main
5. Folder: / (root)
6. Save

### 4. Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Pages takes 5-10 minutes to build
- Check the Actions tab for build status
- Site will be available at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`

## üåê Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### If using webglo.org:
1. **CNAME file**: Already created ‚úÖ
2. **DNS Configuration**: 
   - Point your domain to GitHub Pages IPs:
     - 185.199.108.153
     - 185.199.109.153
     - 185.199.110.153
     - 185.199.111.153
3. **SSL Certificate**: GitHub provides free SSL

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Test these after site is live:

#### Website Functionality:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Services, pricing, about pages display properly
- [ ] Images and assets load from GitHub
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works

#### Contact Form System:
- [ ] Form submits without errors
- [ ] Loading animation appears

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### Form not working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Google Apps Script URL
3. Test script directly in Google Apps Script
4. Check Gmail permissions

#### CSS/JS not loading:
1. Verify file paths are relative
2. Check files exist in repository
3. Clear browser cache

#### Images not displaying:
1. Check image file paths
2. Ensure images are in repository
3. Verify file extensions match

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### After Deployment:
1. **Form Submissions**: Monitor Google Sheets for new entries
2. **Email Delivery**: Check Gmail sent folder
